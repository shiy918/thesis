# Abstract

Food is essential to maintain human physiology. Consumptions of unclean and unsafe food could lead to serious consequences that likely to have impact on all aspects of human activities. This research project was dedicated to study food safety issues, looking closely at food recall enforcements documented by Food and Drug Administration. Out of over 14,000 recall cases authorized in the United States, roughly around 100 involved food imported from foreign companies in countries that span over five continents, and much more than 100 involved food produced in the United States but exported to other parts of the world. The reasons for recalls differ case by case, but with large amount of which caused by bacteria and virus contamination including, to name a few, Salmonella, Chloramphenicol and Listeria monocytogenes as well containment of allergens such as undeclared hazelnut. Such contamination and questionable ingredients have led to numerous food borne illness outbreaks documented by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For each recall case, this project aims at investigating in its sources, details and destinations from a not only domestic but also global perspective.
